# PEAK Voice Volume Saver

Hate resetting your friends' volume every time you load into a new game?<br>

Introducing, "PEAK Voice Volume Saver", a mod for PEAK which saves the voice settings you set for all of your friends! 

## Manual Installation

1.) Download Bepinex from [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.23.3/BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.3.zip) <br>
2.) Extract the contents of that zip into your game directory (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PEAK) resulting in a folder that has the following files: <br>

3.) Start the game and close it again, this does the first time set up for Bepinex. <br>
4.) Navigate to ...\PEAK\BepInEx\plugins, copy and paste the VoiceVolumeSaver.dll from Manual Download into this folder. <br>
5.) Run the game <br>

## Important
- DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE COMPLAIN ABOUT BUGS TO THE DEVELOPERS WHILE USING MODS. UNINSTALL MODS IF YOU ENCOUNTER BUGS AND THEN REPORT THEM IF THEY ARE STILL PRESENT.
- Currently experimental, things worked in my limited testing.

## Help
- You can find your PEAK folder by **right clicking the game in your Steam library** then > **Manage** > **Browse Local Files**
- If you have issues with auto install, try manually installing with the version of BepInEx that I link above.
- Please report issues to [the mods github](https://github.com/glarmer/PEAK-Voice-Volume-Saver), alternatively I will periodically check the [steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3501916945&tscn=1750268995)

3.) Start the game and close it again, this does the first time set up for Bepinex. <br>
4.) Navigate to ...\PEAK\BepInEx\plugins, copy and paste the voice_volume_saver.dll from [Manual Download ](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/glarmer/PEAK_Voice_Volume_Saver/) into this folder. <br>

## Important
- DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE COMPLAIN ABOUT BUGS TO THE DEVELOPERS WHILE USING MODS. UNINSTALL MODS IF YOU ENCOUNTER BUGS AND THEN REPORT THEM IF THEY ARE STILL PRESENT.
- Currently experimental, things worked in my limited testing.

## Help
- You can find your PEAK folder by **right clicking the game in your Steam library** then > **Manage** > **Browse Local Files**
- If you have issues with auto install, try manually installing with the version of BepInEx that I link above.
- Please report issues to [the mods github](https://github.com/glarmer/PEAK-Voice-Volume-Saver), alternatively I will periodically check the [steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3501916945&tscn=1750268995)
